    "summary": "I Live in from Houston. I have earned my degree from the University of Oklahoma. Boomer Sooner! Before attending The Iron Yard, I worked as a Audio Video Technician at Ford AV. I specialized in front end engineering (React) at The Iron Yard. I really enjoy working in HTML, CSS, javascript, and React but am familiar with node.js, mongoDB, SQL, pulling data from API's and building databases.

    My non-work interests range from brewing my own craft beer to watching EPL soccer with my daugther and of course my Sooners on saturdays.",
